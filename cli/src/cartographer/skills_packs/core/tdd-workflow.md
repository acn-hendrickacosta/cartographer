# Test-Driven Development Workflow

This skill ensures all code development follows TDD principles with comprehensive test coverage.

## When to Activate

- Writing new features or functionality
- Fixing bugs or issues
- Refactoring existing code
- Adding API endpoints
- Creating new components

## Core Principles

### 1. Tests BEFORE Code
ALWAYS write tests first, then implement code to make tests pass.

### 2. Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% coverage (unit + integration + E2E)
- All edge cases covered
- Error scenarios tested
- Boundary conditions verified

### 3. Test Types

#### Unit Tests
- Individual functions and utilities
- Component logic
- Pure functions
- Helpers and utilities

#### Integration Tests
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- Service interactions
- External API calls

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Critical user flows
- Complete workflows
- Browser automation
- UI interactions

### 4. Git Checkpoints
- If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit after each TDD stage
- Do not squash or rewrite these checkpoint commits until the workflow is complete
- Each checkpoint commit message must describe the stage and the exact evidence captured
- Count only commits created on the current active branch for the current task
- Do not treat commits from other branches, earlier unrelated work, or distant branch history as valid checkpoint evidence
- Before treating a checkpoint as satisfied, verify that the commit is reachable from the current `HEAD` on the active branch and belongs to the current task sequence
- The preferred compact workflow is:
  - one commit for failing test added and RED validated
  - one commit for minimal fix applied and GREEN validated
  - one optional commit for refactor complete
- Squash merges are allowed only after the workflow evidence has been preserved in Step 8. If checkpoint commits will be squashed, copy the RED/GREEN/refactor summary into the PR body, squash commit body, or evidence report so reviewers can still answer what was verified and how.

## TDD Workflow Steps

### Step 0: Detect the Test Runner

Do not assume `npm test`. The commands in the steps and examples below use `<test>`, `<test-watch>`, and `<coverage>` as placeholders for the project's actual runner. Resolve them before starting:

1. Inspect `package.json` `scripts.test` and the test files to determine the runner.
2. Distinguish the package manager from the test runner — they are not the same. A project can use Bun to install dependencies yet still run Jest or Vitest.

Runner command matrix:

| Runner | `<test>` | `<test-watch>` | `<coverage>` | `<lint>` |
|--------|----------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| npm | `npm test` | `npm test -- --watch` | `npm run test:coverage` | `npm run lint` |
| pnpm | `pnpm test` | `pnpm test --watch` | `pnpm test:coverage` | `pnpm lint` |
| yarn | `yarn test` | `yarn test --watch` | `yarn test:coverage` | `yarn lint` |
| Bun (script runs jest/vitest) | `bun run test` | `bun run test --watch` | `bun run test:coverage` | `bun run lint` |
| Bun (native `bun:test`) | `bun test` | `bun test --watch` | `bun test --coverage` | `bun run lint` |

### Step 1: Write User Journeys

```
As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]

Example:
As a user, I want to search for markets semantically,
so that I can find relevant markets even without exact keywords.
```

### Step 2: Generate Test Cases
For each user journey, create comprehensive test cases:

```typescript
describe('Semantic Search', () => {
  it('returns relevant markets for query', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  })

  it('handles empty query gracefully', async () => {
    // Test edge case
  })

  it('falls back to substring search when Redis unavailable', async () => {
    // Test fallback behavior
  })

  it('sorts results by similarity score', async () => {
    // Test sorting logic
  })
})
```

### Step 3: Run Tests (They Should Fail)
```bash
<test>
# Tests should fail - we haven't implemented yet
```

This step is mandatory and is the RED gate for all production changes.

Before modifying business logic or other production code, verify a valid RED state:
- Runtime RED: the relevant test target compiles successfully, the new test is actually executed, and the result is RED
- Compile-time RED: the new test references the buggy code path and the compile failure is the intended RED signal
- In either case, the failure is caused by the intended business-logic bug or missing implementation — not by unrelated syntax errors or broken test setup

A test that was only written but not compiled and executed does not count as RED.

Do not edit production code until this RED state is confirmed.

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after this stage is validated.

### Step 4: Implement Code
Write minimal code to make tests pass:

```typescript
// Implementation guided by tests
export async function searchMarkets(query: string) {
  // Implementation here
}
```

### Step 5: Run Tests Again
```bash
<test>
# Tests should now pass
```

Rerun the same relevant test target after the fix and confirm the previously failing test is now GREEN.

Only after a valid GREEN result may you proceed to refactor.

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after GREEN is validated.

### Step 6: Refactor
Improve code quality while keeping tests green:
- Remove duplication
- Improve naming
- Optimize performance
- Enhance readability

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after refactoring is complete and tests remain green.

### Step 7: Verify Coverage
```bash
<coverage>
# Verify 80%+ coverage achieved
```

### Step 8: Write a TDD Evidence Report

After GREEN and coverage are validated, write a short human-readable evidence report. The report is not a replacement for test code; it is an index that explains what the test code proves and preserves that proof across session restarts or squash merges.

Recommended path:

```text
docs/releases/<version>/<plan-or-task-name>.tdd.md
.github/tdd/<plan-or-task-name>.tdd.md
.claude/tdd/<plan-or-task-name>.tdd.md
```

Include:

1. **User journeys** - list the journeys written in Step 1.
2. **Task report** - for each implemented behavior, record:
   - one-sentence execution summary
   - validation command actually run
   - relevant output excerpt, including RED and GREEN results
   - what is guaranteed by the passing tests
3. **Test specification** - a table of human-readable guarantees:

```markdown
| # | What is guaranteed | Test file or command | Test type | Result | Evidence |
|---|--------------------|----------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Empty search returns an empty result list without throwing | `src/search.test.ts:returns empty list for empty query` | unit | PASS | `npm test -- search.test.ts` |
| 2 | API rejects invalid limit values with HTTP 400 | `src/api/markets/route.test.ts:validates query parameters` | integration | PASS | `npm test -- route.test.ts` |
```

4. **Coverage and known gaps** - include the coverage command/result and explain any intentional gaps.

Keep the report factual. Quote actual commands and outcomes; do not invent PASS results for tests that were not run.

## Testing Patterns

### Unit Test Pattern (Jest/Vitest)
```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'
import { Button } from './Button'

describe('Button Component', () => {
  it('renders with correct text', () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>)
    expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('calls onClick when clicked', () => {
    const handleClick = jest.fn()
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click</Button>)

    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'))

    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  })

  it('is disabled when disabled prop is true', () => {
    render(<Button disabled>Click</Button>)
    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeDisabled()
  })
})
```

### Bun Native Test Pattern (`bun:test`)

When the project uses Bun's built-in runner, import from `bun:test` and run with `bun test` — not `bun run test`.

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, mock } from 'bun:test'
import { searchMarkets } from './search'

describe('searchMarkets', () => {
  it('returns an empty list for an empty query', async () => {
    expect(await searchMarkets('')).toEqual([])
  })

  it('sorts results by similarity score', async () => {
    const results = await searchMarkets('election')
    expect(results).toEqual([...results].sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score))
  })
})
```

```bash
bun test              # run once (RED/GREEN gate)
bun test --watch      # watch mode during development
bun test --coverage   # coverage report
```

### API Integration Test Pattern
```typescript
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { GET } from './route'

describe('GET /api/markets', () => {
  it('returns markets successfully', async () => {
    const request = new NextRequest('http://localhost/api/markets')
    const response = await GET(request)
    const data = await response.json()

    expect(response.status).toBe(200)
    expect(data.success).toBe(true)
    expect(Array.isArray(data.data)).toBe(true)
  })

  it('validates query parameters', async () => {
    const request = new NextRequest('http://localhost/api/markets?limit=invalid')
    const response = await GET(request)

    expect(response.status).toBe(400)
  })

  it('handles database errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Mock database failure
    const request = new NextRequest('http://localhost/api/markets')
    // Test error handling
  })
})
```

### E2E Test Pattern (Playwright)
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('user can search and filter markets', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/')
  await page.click('a[href="/markets"]')

  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('Markets')

  await page.fill('input[placeholder="Search markets"]', 'election')
  await page.waitForTimeout(600)

  const results = page.locator('[data-testid="market-card"]')
  await expect(results).toHaveCount(5, { timeout: 5000 })

  const firstResult = results.first()
  await expect(firstResult).toContainText('election', { ignoreCase: true })
})
```

## Test File Organization

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Button/
│   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   ├── Button.test.tsx          # Unit tests
│   │   └── Button.stories.tsx       # Storybook
│   └── MarketCard/
│       ├── MarketCard.tsx
│       └── MarketCard.test.tsx
├── app/
│   └── api/
│       └── markets/
│           ├── route.ts
│           └── route.test.ts         # Integration tests
└── e2e/
    ├── markets.spec.ts               # E2E tests
    ├── trading.spec.ts
    └── auth.spec.ts
```

## Coverage Thresholds
```json
{
  "jest": {
    "coverageThresholds": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 80,
        "functions": 80,
        "lines": 80,
        "statements": 80
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Common Testing Mistakes to Avoid

```typescript
// WRONG: Testing Implementation Details
expect(component.state.count).toBe(5)

// CORRECT: Test User-Visible Behavior
expect(screen.getByText('Count: 5')).toBeInTheDocument()

// WRONG: Brittle Selectors
await page.click('.css-class-xyz')

// CORRECT: Semantic Selectors
await page.click('button:has-text("Submit")')
await page.click('[data-testid="submit-button"]')

// WRONG: No Test Isolation (tests depend on each other)

// CORRECT: Independent Tests
test('creates user', () => {
  const user = createTestUser()
  // Test logic
})
test('updates user', () => {
  const user = createTestUser()
  // Update logic
})
```

## Best Practices

1. **Write Tests First** - Always TDD
2. **One Assert Per Test** - Focus on single behavior
3. **Descriptive Test Names** - Explain what's tested
4. **Arrange-Act-Assert** - Clear test structure
5. **Mock External Dependencies** - Isolate unit tests
6. **Test Edge Cases** - Null, undefined, empty, large
7. **Test Error Paths** - Not just happy paths
8. **Keep Tests Fast** - Unit tests < 50ms each
9. **Clean Up After Tests** - No side effects
10. **Review Coverage Reports** - Identify gaps
